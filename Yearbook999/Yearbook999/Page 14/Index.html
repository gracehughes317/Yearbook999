                    What's the first thing that comes to your mind when you
                    hear the word ‘cells’?
                    </p><p>
                    For Stephen Wetter, it’s art. Wetter is BC’s first
                    national gold key winner in 17 years, and it hasn’t been
                    without a lot of hard work.
                </p><p>
                    Throughout high school, he spent countless hours
                    compiling a large quantity of paintings and drawings to
                    prove his skill and love for the arts. Wetter created and
                    finalized his nationally-ranked piece in Mrs. Scott’s class
                    over the duration of Art Seminar with Ms. Sarah Scott
                    and named it “Cells.”
                </p><p>
                    “It’s always a hard decision to decide which artwork
                    I want to send off to get judged,” Scott admitted. “It’s like
                    picking a favorite child, but I knew that with Stephen he
                    truly had what it took.”
                </p><p>
                    The process wasn’t very easy. The piece was
                    originally sent out and put on display in downtown
                    Milwaukee at the Milwaukee Public Art Museum, where
                    after receiving multiple awards from local critics, it was
                    sent to be judged in New York City at the national level.
                    This wait was agonizing for Wetter, but the final award
                    proved worth it. Winning this award meant that Stephen’s
                    work was considered by prestigious artists, writers, and
                    professionals across the nation to be among the top one
                    percent of all young artists, an unimaginable honor.
                </p><p>
                    After Wetter’s artwork won the most elite prize
                    possible, it began a long two-year journey back to New
                    York, after a brief visit home, where it will travel from
                    gallery to gallery around the U.S. to display the true
                    brilliance of the piece for museum-goers. With his piece
                    traveling, and the stress and anxiety from the judging
                    over, Stephen continues to add to his ever growing
                    collection of art with a newfound confidence thanks to
                    the success of a piece that some could say wasn’t such a
                    hard cell.
