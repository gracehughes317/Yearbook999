                        After qualifying for state in 2014, the Brookfield Central Boys golf team took a huge hit, losing 60 percent of their starting lineup.
                        The only returning members were Sean Yun ('16) and Josh Trasser ('16). The three vacant spots in the lineup were filled up by Kevin
                        Hershberger ('16), Brandon Talaska ('17), and Zach Mindel ('18). Even with the huge change, the boys began the season with the same goals
                        as the previous year: win conference, qualify for state, and be successful.

                        The future of the team might have looked bleak to most, but Yun never doubted them. "We had many guys from last year's reserve team
                        that were ready to play," He said. Talaska agreedm "I was so motivated to work my heart out and improve, as did everyone else."

                    <p>
                        With this attitude, the team approached every opportunity a positively as it could. Even though the boys did not meet the first two
                        goals on the list, they were still able to achieve the third. They might not have placed first in the GMC, but all of the athletes
                        achieved new personal bests in their high school careers. Talaska had a 39 at the 3rd Conference mini-meet, Mindel an 83 at sectionals,
                        Hershberger a 79 at regionals, and Yun a 74 at the Waukesha County Championship. They might not have qualified for state, but they sent
                        Trasser, who, after shooting his career-best 76 at sectionals, moved on as an individual. He finished the season ranked 21st in Wisconsin.

                        Looking back, Yun and Talaska were not disappointed. Yun explained, "Although we struggled, we are proud of our season. We worked
                        hard and will continue to work hard and even better next year."
