        Team bonding can take place anywhere,
        whether it be on the field or before the
        season even begins. However, the varsity
        girls’ soccer team bonded over something
        very different: karaoke!
        Before the season started, the soccer
        team went to an overnight camp at Camp
        Minikani. “It was a team bonding trip
        before the regular season started. We had a
        practice in the morning, did different team
        bonding exercises in the cold weather, and
        then sang karaoke,” Brandi Thomsen (‘18)
        recalled. The girls built trust and teamwork

        by participating in team-building exercises

        such as a low ropes course and a follow-
        the-leader guided walk.

        These activities had tremendous effects
        on the team, allowing them to communicate
        better, both on and off the field.
        “I created a stronger connection with
        my teammates,” Rachel Kolb (‘16) said. “I
        felt closer to each girl, which allowed me
        to depend on them throughout the season
        for our games. I understood their best and
        worst aspects as a soccer player and person
        in general.” The team was able to connect

        as teammates and friends, resulting in one
        of the most connected and comedic teams
        in Brookfield Central soccer history.
        Liz Busch (‘17) explained, “I think
        everyone realized that, in order to make
        that season successful, we all needed
        to recognize each other’s strengths and
        weaknesses. We realized that we couldn’t be
        successful unless we all worked together.”
        The team agreed that this is something that
        brought them together in ways that let them
        dominate the field.
