                Team bonding can take place anywhere,
                whether it be on the field or before the
                season even begins. However, the varsity
                girls’ soccer team bonded over something
                very different: karaoke!
                Before the season started, the soccer
                team went to an overnight camp at Camp
                Minikani. “It was a team bonding trip
                before the regular season started. We had a
                practice in the morning, did different team
                bonding exercises in the cold weather, and
                then sang karaoke,” Brandi Thomsen (‘18)
                recalled. The girls built trust and teamwork
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                by participating in team-building exercises

                such as a low ropes course and a follow-
                the-leader guided walk.

                These activities had tremendous effects
                on the team, allowing them to communicate
                better, both on and off the field.
                “I created a stronger connection with
                my teammates,” Rachel Kolb (‘16) said. “I
                felt closer to each girl, which allowed me
                to depend on them throughout the season
                for our games. I understood their best and
                worst aspects as a soccer player and person
                in general.” The team was able to connect
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                as teammates and friends, resulting in one
                of the most connected and comedic teams
                in Brookfield Central soccer history.
                Liz Busch (‘17) explained, “I think
                everyone realized that, in order to make
                that season successful, we all needed
                to recognize each other’s strengths and
                weaknesses. We realized that we couldn’t be
                successful unless we all worked together.”
                The team agreed that this is something that
                brought them together in ways that let them
                dominate the field.
